This module binds a product packaging to a packaging level.

There are usually 3 levels:

- The primary: it is the closest to the product, also called the retail
  packaging
- The secondary: it allows to ship the products already in the primary
  packaging, like a box
- The tertiary: it allows to ship large quantities in warehousing, like
  a pallet

This differentiates from the odoo standard package type that is typing
the packaging in a more precise way and that can serve for put-away
routing in the warehouse.

For example a small box and a large box, or an EPAL pallet and CHEP
pallet.
