This module binds a product packaging to a packaging level.

There are usually 3 levels:

* The primary: it is the closest to the product, also called the retail packaging
* The secondary: it allows to ship the products already in the primary packaging, like a box
* The tertiary: it allows to ship large quantities in warehousing, like a pallet

This differentiates from the odoo standard package type that is typing the packaging in a more
precise way and that can serve for put-away routing in the warehouse.

For example a small box and a large box, or an EPAL pallet and CHEP pallet.
