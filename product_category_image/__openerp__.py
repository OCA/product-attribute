This module add the posibility to add an image to a
category. This can be usefull for e-commerce purpose,
for product paper catalog, for quotation that need image
related to the category of the product ...

Note : for now this module only add the support of one image,
some e-commerce give the posbility to manage various images
but in practice customer rarely use it because it's too much aditionnal work.

Depending of the need of the next customer we may implement the support
of multi-image, but as we want a really simple UI we stick on one image
