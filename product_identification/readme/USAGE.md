Tracking Product Identifications:

Allows organizations to assign specific identification numbers to products and categorize them based on type.
Identification numbers can be issued by different partners and tracked with details such as the place and date of issue.
Helps in managing compliance or regulatory requirements by associating specific products with required identification documentation.
Product Expiry Notifications:

The module includes functionality to automatically notify responsible users or managers when a product's identification number is about to expire.
This can be useful for maintaining up-to-date records and ensuring that products with expiring IDs are addressed, helping in legal compliance or inventory accuracy.
Enhanced Product Information:

The identification numbers are integrated into the product template, allowing users to view identification details directly from the product form.
This additional layer of information gives a more comprehensive view of the product, aiding decision-making for inventory managers, compliance officers, or supply chain teams.
