* Ensure the 'Sale Price' setting is set to 'Advanced pricing based on formulas . . . ' in the Sales app.
* In the pricelist form view, click 'Edit'.
* Click on one of the pricelist items.
* Set 'Apply On' To 'Product' and choose a product.
* Set 'Compute Price' to 'Tiered Price'.
* In the field that shows up below 'Tiered Price', input your desired price at 'Minimum Quantity' you specify.
* Notice the 'Price Discount' field automatically changes. The logic divides your desired price by the minimum quantity
  to get the new unit price, and then compares that unit price with the original unit price of the product to achieve the price discount.
* Note the tiered pricing uses the product's Public Price, or in field terms, list_price, for calculations.
* Also note, in certain situations (e.g. $10 tiered price for 3 items) you may need to use the rounding methods available.
