Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV)

The common procurement vocabulary (CPV) establishes a single classification
system for public procurement aimed at standardising the references used by
contracting authorities and entities to describe procurement contracts.

This module contains the CPV codes found in Regulation (EC) 213/2008 and allows
its users to set them on the product forms.
