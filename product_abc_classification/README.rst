This modules provides the bases to build ABC analysis (or ABC classification)
addons. These classification are used by inventory management teams to help
identify the most important products in their portfolio and ensure they
prioritize managing them above those less valuable.

Managers will create a profile with several levels (percentages) and then the
profiled products will automatically get a corresponding level using the
ABC classification.

The addon *product_abc_classification_sale_stock* defines a computation profile
based on the number of sale order line delivered by product.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Sales or Inventory menu, then to Configuration/Products/ABC Classification Profile
and create a profile with levels, knowing that the sum of all levels in the profile
should sum 100 and all the levels should be different.

#. Later you should go to product categories or product variants, and assign them a profile.
Then the cron classification will proceed to assign to these products one of the profile's levels.

NOTE: If you profile (or unprofile) a product category, then all its
child categories and products will be profiled (or unprofiled).
