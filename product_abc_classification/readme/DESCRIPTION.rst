This modules provides the bases to build ABC analysis (or ABC classification)
addons. These classification are used by inventory management teams to help
identify the most important products in their portfolio and ensure they
prioritize managing them above those less valuable.

Managers will create a profile with several levels (percentages) and then the
profiled products will automatically get a corresponding level using the
ABC classification.

The addon *product_abc_classification_sale_stock* defines a computation profile
based on the number of sale order line delivered by product.
