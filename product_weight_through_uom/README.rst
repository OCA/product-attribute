This module allows to use the unit of measure as a reference for the product
weight. So a product with a UoM of Kg will have a weight of 1.0 Kg. and a
product with a UoM of grams will have a weight of 0.001 Kg.

It still allows to adjust the total weight manually with an extra field.

Installation
============

Although it's not a direct dependency of this module you will need to have
*Sale Management* or *Inventory* installed in order to use Units of Measure.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*.
#. In the *Product* section set *Units of Measure* on.

The decimal precission of the weight field is set to 2 digits by default so if
you need more decimals (i.e.: grams are 0,001 Kg and would be rounded to 0.00!)
you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Decimal Accuracy*
#. Edit *Stock Weight* and set *Digits* to your needs.

Usage
=====

#. Go to a product and change its UoM to any in the Weight category.
#. Go to the *Inventory* tab and you'll see the weight has changed to the
   proper conversion.
#. Additionaly you can set an additional weight that will sum to the calculated
   one.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* There's an incompatibility with the module `delivery` because of the way this
  one computes the `stock.quant.package` and `stock.picking` weight based on
  unit conversion multiplied by product weight.

  E. g.: A product with a UoM of Tons will have a weight of 1000 Kg. `delivery`
  computes it this way for every quant package or picking line:

  - Converts the product Uom (Tons) to the line Uom (e.g.: Kg.) = 1000
  - Multiplies it by the line quantity (e.g.: 5) = 5000
  - Then multiplies it by the product weight = 50000

  This would be a correct compute if the UoM wouldn't be a weight measure
  itself.
