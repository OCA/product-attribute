        This module simplifies the stock rule managment.
        Two fields have been added on product view : 'active_rule' and 'min_qty'
        If you click on 'active rule' and select a 'min_qty' a stock rule will be automatically
        generated.
        If you unselect the 'active rule' the rule will be deactivated 
        and the field min_qty will be read only.
