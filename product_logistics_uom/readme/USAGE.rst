Once installed and the 'Sell and purchase products in different units of measure'
option is enabled, the 'Unit of Measure' field will become updatable on the
'Product' form for users with the permission 'Manage Multiple Units of Measure'.

If the displayed value is 0.00 and a warning icon is displayed in front of the
unit of measure, it means that the value is too small to be displayed in the
current unit of measure. You should change the unit of measure to a larger one
to see the value.
