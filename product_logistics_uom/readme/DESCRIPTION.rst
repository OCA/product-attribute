This module allows to choose an Unit Of Measure (UoM) for products weight and volume.
It can be set product per product.

Without this module, you only have the choice between Kg or Lb(s) and m³ for all the products.

For some business cases, you need to express in more precise UoM than default ones like Liters
instead of M³.
