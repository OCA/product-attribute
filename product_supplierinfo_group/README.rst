Product price values can be tedious and error-prone to enter one by one when you need to repeat the same values:

* vendor,
* product name,
* variant
* product code

Whereas most of the time you just want to enter the minimum quantities, price, dates, delay.

With this module, price lines look to their parent (product.supplierinfo.group) in order to get the values from these repetitive fields.

In addition, it adds a computed field that summarizes all price/quantities deals.

Here are some screenshots for before/after comparison.

Before:

Boring and error prone !

After:

Much better for the user.

Usage
=====

Go to the Product page, under the Purchase tab. Enter product prices with the new interface. It is mostly the same as before,
except you don't need to repeat information on all price lines.
