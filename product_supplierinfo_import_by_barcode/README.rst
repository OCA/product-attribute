This module allows to import vendor price lists from excel files
matching the products from their barcode.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Vendor pricelists sheet files could come in a variety of column formats.
We can configure templates to match them to know what data we need to
store in our pricelist.

To do so:

1. Go to *Purchase > Configuration > Vendor pricelist import templates*.
2. Edit or create a new one.
3. Set the name of the header to match by barcode.
4. Set a headers mapping with the rest header names and which fields we
   should update.
5. A header mapping could have no related field, but is important to
   have it if we want to detect the sheet data when we are importing.
6. The order isn't important.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Purchase > Configuration > Import vendor pricelists*.
2. Upload your vendor pricelists sheet file.
3. Set the vendor partner, the date from which the pricelists are valid
   and the lead days.
4. Click on import and view.

I a template for that file is configured, it will match the headers with
the column values and create or update the vendor pricelists
accordingly.
