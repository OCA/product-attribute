Vendor pricelists sheet files could come in a variety of column formats. We can configure
templates to match them to know what data we need to store in our pricelist.

To do so:

1. Go to *Purchase > Configuration > Vendor pricelist import templates*.
2. Edit or create a new one.
3. Set the name of the header to match by barcode.
4. Set a headers mapping with the rest header names and which fields we should update.
5. A header mapping could have no related field, but is important to have it if we want
   to detect the sheet data when we are importing.
5. The order isn't important.
