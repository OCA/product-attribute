By default in Odoo, on the `product.template` and `product.product` form
views, the list of the available Purchase UoM is not filtered.
(`uom_po_id` field)

So the UI is proposing all the uoms, even those that are not consistent
with the selected main UoM. (defined in the `uom_id` field.)

This module extends the functionallity of product module, adding a
domain on this field.
