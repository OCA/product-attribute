To configure multiple prices you need to set multi prices field names first.
To do so, you need admin permissions. Then go to:

#. *Settings > General Settings > Technical > Database Structure >
   Price Field Names*
#. Create the multi price fields you need.

If you have multiple companies, you can assign independet field sets for each
one.
