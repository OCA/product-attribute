This module adds the possibility to show certain product relations in a
tab on the product form, in addition to in the list of all relations.

This can be useful if certain relation types are regularly used and should
be overseeable at a glace.

For instance you can make a tab named 'spares' that will show all the spare parts
of the product, by showing the relations of type 'has spare part'.
