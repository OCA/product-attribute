Supplier can suggest a sale price for a product
You can set this suggested sale price as your sale price.

If a product has multiple supplier suggesting a sale price you can decide how to apply the computation of your own sale price:
get the cheapest, the more expensive, compute the mean or not to apply the suggested sale price to your sale price.
(how to compute the sale price is determined by the system parameter: Supplier Sale Price Computation)
