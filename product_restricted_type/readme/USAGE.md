To use this module, you need to go to Inventory -> Configuration -> Product Categories and set a Restricted Product Type.

When a Restricted Product Type is assigned to a Product Category, if we then set a Product Type on a Product Template,
the list of available Product Categories in the dropdown will be filtered with only the ones that have the same
Restricted Product Type as the one set on the Product Template or have no Restricted Product Type set.
