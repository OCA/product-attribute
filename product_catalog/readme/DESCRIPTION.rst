A product catalog is mainly a set of products.

Build on top of product_assortments and it adds the ability
to trigger when products are added or removed from the catalog.

One of the use case is to publish to a marketplace
a list of products:

- First, these products needs to be conform with marketplace rules (product assortment).
- Then, you may want to manage *when* products are added (product catalog)
