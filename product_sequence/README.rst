===========================================
A module that adds sequence to the product.
===========================================

This module allows to associate a sequence to the product reference.
The reference (default code) is unique (SQL constraint) and required.

Installation
============

Prior to installing this module, if you have any existing products you should ensure
they already have a unique reference (or no reference) set.  Products with a default_code of
'/' or empty will automatically be assigned a code of "!!mig!!" followed by the system id for that product.

Otherwise the setting of the unique constraint will fail and the module will fail to install.
