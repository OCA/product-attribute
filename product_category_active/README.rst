Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Products > Product categories*.
#. Select a product category or create a new one.
#. Click on the smart button Archive (this action will set active
   field to False).

Note: If there are products in the category to be archived or any
of its children categories, an error will be raised and it won't be archived.

Note 2: Children category are not archived/unarchived
when the parent category does.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* when you try to deactivate a category from the tree view
  by clicking on the boolean_toggle widget, if a validation
  error pop-up appears indicating that the element cannot be
  deactivated, then the element is NOT deactivated, although
  the corresponding line turns gray as if it had been disabled,
  until that tree view is refreshed.
