In a product form, before addon installation, when enabled pricelist items management, the pricelist tree and form looks like this, e.g. for a discount entry:

.. figure:: ../static/description/pricelist_tree_before.png
   :alt: Tree view before
   :width: 600 px

.. figure:: ../static/description/pricelist_form_before.png
   :alt: Form view before
   :width: 600 px

After installation, tree and view forms shows the same and complete information that pricelist menu does:

.. figure:: ../static/description/pricelist_tree_after.png
   :alt: Tree view after
   :width: 600 px

.. figure:: ../static/description/pricelist_form_after.png
   :alt: Form view after
   :width: 600 px
