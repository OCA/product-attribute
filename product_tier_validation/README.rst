Adds an approval workflow to Products.
The default rule requires new Product to be approved
before they can be used.

For this, the new Product record is kept as "Archived" until it is approved.

Installation
============

This module depends on ``base_tier_validation``. You can find it at
`OCA/server-ux <https://github.com/OCA/server-ux>`_

Usage
=====

A regular user creates a new Product and sends it for approval:

#. Create a Product triggering at least one "Tier Definition".
   Product will be in In Development state and marked as Archived until approved.
#. Click on *Request Validation* button.
#. In the *Reviews* section, at the bottom of the form, inspect the pending reviews and their status.


The approver reviews Products to approve:

#. Now select the filter "Needs my Approval" from Product list view.
#. Open the Product form to approve. It will display a
   "This Records needs to be validated" banner, with "Validate" and "Reject" options.
#. The approver can change the state to "Normal".
   This will automatically unarchive the record and make it available to be used.


The Approve/Reject actions do not automatically change the State.
This could be a future improvement.
