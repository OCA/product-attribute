With this module you can add **stickers** (aka Images) to Product Attributes, Product
Attributes Values or Categories. Also you can put a text below the sticker if you want.

A sticker could be the image of a stamps, certifications or other images related
to a product (but not the image of a product) or an attribute or a value of an
attribute to use for reports o other places in Odoo.
For example: ISO, Ecology, Security, Resistance, etc.

This module by itself does not do anything, it is a base module to be
extended by other modules.

A general use case is: we have the use case than depending of the attribute of
the product or the value of the product it is mandatory legally print the
**sticker** in **Delivery slip** of stock picking.

A specific example of use case: when selling ecological products, the European Union
makes it mandatory to print official
`ECO Logo <https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/organic-farming/organic-logo_en>`_
in pickings, and this depends on the product attribute or values.
An apple could be ecologic or not and depending the attribute this should
be printed or not.

Usage
=====

Go to Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Product Stickers.
You can add Stickers to Attributes resulting in different behaviours:
- If an Image has no Company, it will be available to all Companies
- If an Image has no Attribute, it will be available to all Attributes
- If an Image has no Attribute Value, it will be available to all Attribute
Values of the Attribute
- If an Image has no Category, it will be available to all Categories

You can mix behaviours to create a very flexible sticker system
