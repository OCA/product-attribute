Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo has an option to define optional products for products. However
sometimes optional product may have different quantity in relation to
the main one. For example you have a "Tea party set" product which
consists of 4 tea cups. Your customers can also buy same cups
separately. In this case "Tea cup" will be an optional product for "Tee
party set" with quantity multiplier 4. So when you add  "Tear party set"
with quantity=2 to quotation "Tea cup" with quantity=8 will be added in
the "Optional products" tab. 

Configuration
=============

Go to Settings > Sales tab In the "Product Catalog" section enable
"Optional Products Quantity" feature

Open a product and go to the "Sales" tab. Add optional products with
quantities in the "Optional Products" field.

Usage
=====

Usage flow is implemented in modules depending on this one.
