When using advanced price rules:

1.  Go to a pricelist and create a pricelist with a given currency.
2.  Create a new pricelist rule with computation formula.
3.  Make it based on other pricelist that uses a different currency.
4.  *Fixed Currency Rate* will show up, set a value.

This will force the currency conversion to always use the specified
*Fixed Currency Rate* rate when using this pricelist.
