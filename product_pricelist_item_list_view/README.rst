=========================
Pricelist rules list view
=========================

This module adds a new menu item "Pricelist rules" to list and search every pricelist rule.
This is useful when you have many rules and you want to search among them.
For instance, if you have many fixed price rules associated to product variants, without this module you could not easily find a variant's price.
