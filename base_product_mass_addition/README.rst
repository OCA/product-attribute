This module is abstract and can't be used as is.

It provides functions in order to show a product grid from another model.
You can then add products and quantities in batch to the model you are working with.

It is useful when you don't want to add every product line possible to your object.
From the product grid you only have to set the quantity for each product.

Example implementations:
 - purchase_quick
 - stock_picking_quick

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The module uses Form emulation from backend.
Once onchange_helper is stabilized, we should switch to it
because it is more robust and has better perfs.

Also adding new implementations would be great:
on sale.order or on stock.picking.batch for instance.
