Configuration
=============

Lot Sequence policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways you can configure this module through the use of System Parameter
`product_lot_sequence.policy`:

- "product": This is the default behaviour once you install this module. It's the
  same than in previous Odoo versions with this module installed, i.e. it allows
  to define a dedicated sequence on each product.

- "global": This was the default behaviour from previous Odoo versions when this
  module was not installed, i.e it will always use the same global sequence for every product.

If any other value is used for this System Parameter, then you will get the default
behaviour from odoo 15.0 which will look for the last lot number for each product and
will increment it.

Default Number of Digits for Product Sequence Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default is 7 digits.  To change that to something else, go to the inventory
configuration, find "Sequence Number of Digits" and change the number.

Usage
=====

To use this module:

* Go to Inventory > Products
* Under the inventory tab when tracking set to lots 4 new fields will be displayed
* If a sequence is not selected, a new one using the prefix, padding and next number fields, will be created
* Go to Inventory > Lot/Serial Numbers
* Create new Lot/Serial number
* Select the product and the next number of the product sequence will be automatically proposed
