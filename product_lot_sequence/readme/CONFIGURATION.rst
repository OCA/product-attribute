There are two ways you can configure this module through the use of System Parameter
`product_lot_sequence.policy`:

- "product": This is the default behaviour once you install this module. It's the
  same than in previous Odoo versions with this module installed, i.e. it allows
  to define a dedicated sequence on each product.

- "global": This was the default behaviour from previous Odoo versions when this
  module was not installed, i.e it will always use the same global sequence for every product.

If any other value is used for this System Parameter, then you will get the default
behaviour from odoo 15.0 which will look for the last lot number for each product and
will increment it.
