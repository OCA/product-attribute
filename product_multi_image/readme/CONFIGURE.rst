You can manage your images at Product template level:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products* and choose a product template.
#. Go to the *Images* tab.
#. Add a new image or edit the existing ones.
#. You can select for which variants you want to make available the image.
   Keep it empty for making visible in all.
#. Refresh the page.
#. The first image in the collection is the main image for the product
   template.

Going to product variants form, you can manage also your images, but take
into account this behaviour:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Product Variants* and choose a product variant.
#. If you add an image here, the image is actually added to the product
   template, and restricted to this variant.
#. When editing an existing image, the image is changed generally for all
   the variants where is enabled, not only for this variant.
#. When removing an image from this form, if the image is only in this variant,
   the image is removed. Otherwise, the image gets restricted to the rest of
   the variants where is available.
