This module allows to compute a graphical hint stored in the product itself to display
whether or not that product was sold and delivered in the past weeks.

Configuration
=============

We can configure some variables with config parameter keys:

- For the hint characters:

  - For the sold char: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.sold_char`
  - For the not sold: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.not_sold_char`
- For weeks length: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.weeks_to_consider`

Usage
=====

Once configured, you can view the hints as an optional column in sale order lines or
in the tree of the products.

Only salesmen can access to this information.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Services aren't taken into consideration.
* A widget could be done on top of the main field to have nicer icons or even colors.
* For the future, maybe a configurable granularity could be made, so we could
  change the behaviour to months, days, years as the period of choice. To simplify
  the module, for the moment only the week will be considered.
