This modules includes the ABC analysis (or ABC classification), which is
used by inventory management teams to help identify the most important
products in their portfolio and ensure they prioritize managing them above
those less valuable.

Managers will create a profile with several levels (percentages) and then the
profiled products will automatically get a corresponding level using the
ABC classification.
