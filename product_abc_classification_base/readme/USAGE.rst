To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Sales or Inventory menu, then to Configuration/Products/ABC Classification Profile
and create a profile with levels, knowing that the sum of all levels in the profile
should sum 100 and all the levels should be different.

#. Later you should go to product categories or product variants, and assign them a profile.
Then the cron classification will proceed to assign to these products one of the profile's levels.

NOTE: If you profile (or unprofile) a product category, then all its
child categories and products will be profiled (or unprofiled).
