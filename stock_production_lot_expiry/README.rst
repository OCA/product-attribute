This module extends the functionality of 'Products Expiration Date'
(product_expiry) to easily detect expired lot.

It adds two new fields on the Lot/Serial model.

* Expiry date (expiry_date)
* Is expired (is_expired)

The 'Expiry date' is a field filled at te creation of a lot/serial with the date
on which the lot/serial is expired. This field is filled from one of the
date fields present on the lot/serial ( 'end of life' or 'best before date' or
'removal date' or 'alert date' or ...). The field to use can be configured at
the product level or the category level.

The 'Is expired' field is a computed field that can be used into the business
code to easily know if a product is expired.

It also allows you to easily search for expired lots.

Configuration
=============


The field to use to fill the 'Expiry date' can be configured a 2 levels:

 * on the product category
 * on the product itself

The name of the field to use for a product is determined as follow:

If the field name is specified on the product, we use this. Otherwise we go
through the category hierarchy until the field name to use is defined. If the
field name is not defined by the category hierarchy we take the one defined
by the config parameter `stock_product_lot_expiry.field_name` (default 'removal_date').
This configuration is available into stock configuration from.
