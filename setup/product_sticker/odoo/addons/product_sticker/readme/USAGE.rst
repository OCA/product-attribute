Go to Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Product Stickers.
You can add Stickers to Attributes resulting in different behaviours:
- If an Image has no Company, it will be available to all Companies
- If an Image has no Attribute, it will be available to all Attributes
- If an Image has no Attribute Value, it will be available to all Attribute
Values of the Attribute
- If an Image has no Category, it will be available to all Categories

You can mix behaviours to create a very flexible sticker system
