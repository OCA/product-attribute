This module allows you to add overcharge amount to sales pricelist based on the price result.
You will be able to create multiple rules/options (just the first match will be applied).
This is usefull when you need to add extra charge base on the actual value computed by the pricelist.
For example, based on the product cost I would like to add and extra margin percentage by ranges. So
with this module you could create a regular pricelist by cost and add the overcharge rules to acomplish this.
