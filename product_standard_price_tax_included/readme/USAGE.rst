User can now set Price List based on this field:

.. image:: ../static/description/product_pricelist_item_form.png
   :width: 100%

The new field is displayed on the product variant form:

.. image:: ../static/description/product_product_form.png
   :width: 100%


In this exemple, if cost is 10â‚¬ (Vat Excl), when we'll use in a sale order
this product, with the pricelist based on cost (vat incl), the computation
of the price will be good.
