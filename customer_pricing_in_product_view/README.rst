Customer Pricing in Product View
================================

This module was written to extend the functionality of products and partners to add a
'Product Pricing' button to the partner view which when clicked will open the product list
with the pricelist set to the customers pricelist.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

* do nothing special

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* do nothing

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Access a customer record
* Click 'Product Pricing' 'smart button' in the button group on the right hand side

This will take you to a list of products, with the price column set to the customers pricelist.

* Search for products as per normal

NOTE: This is just a default, and the pricelist may be changed in the product view to view prices from a different
pricelist.


Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* In previous releases this module was called 'customer_context_in_product_view' and allowed typing in a customers name
directly in the product view.  Unfortunately with changes to the v8 search view handling of functional many2one's
and the deprecation of fields.Dummy this was not easily portable however it is desired to find a more elegant way
of doing this in future.  It might be possible by converting pricelist_id to a related field of a partner field and
removing pricelist from the search view.
* It has previously been requested that this support supplier pricelists as well, however there are certain difficulties
with that approach, not least of which is one supplier rarely supplies all products making displayed prices meaningless.
