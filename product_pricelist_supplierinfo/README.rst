This module allows you to create a sales pricelist based on product
supplierinfo prices. If you want, you can bypass minimum quantity in pricelist
item.

We can also define sale marging applied on purchase price directly on supplier info.
For this, you must add users to "Show sale margin on Product Supplierinfo" group.

Installation
============

Although this module doesn't depend technically on **Sales Management**, you
must install it for configuring and seeing the effects of it.

Configuration
=============

To configure pricelists with the new feature of this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings* and check
   "Pricelists" option and "Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas)"
   after that. You must have correct permissions and you must install
   **Sales Management** app (sale) and **Purchase** app to see these settings.
#. Create or edit a Sales Pricelist at *Sales > Products > Pricelists*.
#. Add or edit a pricelist item and check "Formula" option in
   "Price Computation" section.
#. You will see the new option "Prices based on supplier info".
#. If you want to bypass the "Min.Quantity" field of the supplier info and
   always select the lowest quantity price, check the option
   "Ignore Supplier Info Min. Quantity".

Usage
=====

For adding supplier info:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products*
#. Open or create a product.
#. Go to "Purchase" page.
#. On "Vendors" section, add the supplier and prices.
#. You can drag and drop for reordering these lines.

Check the remark in known issues about the supplier info line selection.

For checking pricelists in action, you can (with `sale` module installed):

#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations*
#. Create or edit a quotation.
#. Add a line.
#. Select a product with the criteria to match the pricelist from supplier
   info.
#. See the proper price appears in the line.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* First line that matches by minimum quantity criteria, independently from the
  supplier, will be the one that provides the price for the pricelist.
* There's no mechanism for selecting the supplier from possible sources like
  sales orders.
