Set UoM in Pricelist Rules.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

In any Pricelist Rule for a Product, set the Min. Quantity and the UoM.

Note that prices in the Pricelist Rule (fixed, margins, surcharge) have to be proportional to the UoM of the Product.

Usage
=====

You sell Sugar by the kg, so its UoM is kg and the product price is 1000€: you are selling it at 1000€/kg (a bit expensive as sugar goes, but you can see why).

One customer is asking for 10g but the price you need for 10g is not 10€ (proportional with the price of 0,01kg) but it is 15€.

With this module, you can configure two price rules:

* | minimum quantity 1g and a surcharge,
  | note that the surcharge is proportional to the original UoM (kg),
  | so in this example the surcharge must be 500€
* minimum quantity 1kg and original price
