Supplier Unit Price on Product Form
===================================

By default, On the product form, in the suppliers tab, you have to click on the
line to get the prices of the product from that supplier.

This module displays the unit price directly on the product form by adding a
function field to store the unit price to the supplierinfo object and adding
it to its tree view.
