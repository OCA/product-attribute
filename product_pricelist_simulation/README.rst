Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to product form view.
#. Click *See Price per Pricelist* button.
#. A new dialog will appear showing the prices for the current date and
   quantity=1 for the current product.
#. You can modify the date to see the prices on that date (if you have
   pricelists with specific intervals of time), or for other quantity (if you
   have pricelists depending on the number).
#. If you have clicked from a product with variants, you will see by default
   the prices for all the existing variants on each shown pricelist, but you
   can select a specific variant in the field "Product Variant" to filter out
   the rest of the variants except the selected one.
