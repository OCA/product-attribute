This module allows to manage product life delays on category level:

- Use Time
- Removal Time
- Alert Time
- Expiration Time

If these values are set on category level, when creating a product and assigning that category or changing that category on existing product,
those value are reflected on product side. Those values can also be set per product.

The 'Use Expiration Date' field that exists on product level is set too on category with the same behavior as above.

Last but not least, activities can be created automatically to warn users for product that have some dates expired (Removal, Use and Expiration).
