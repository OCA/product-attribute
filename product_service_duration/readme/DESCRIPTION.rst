Extension of products (services only) that allows them to be added to calendars.

As a note, if you add services with a `Minimum Time` (minimum time it
takes to complete that service) to an event, the meeting/event duration cannot
be less than the combined minimum time of those services.

For example, say your meeting involves two services, technical and design services.
If the technical service requires 2 hours and design requires 3 hours, then your
meeting must be at least 5 hours.

The above constraint does not apply on events that have `All Day` selected.

When changing the `Minimum Time` on services, this will not affect events that have
already ended.
