A **product set** is a list of products which are usually used together.

This module aims to help defining several products under a name, for later
being added in a quick way into other document.

After a *product set* is added, each line can be updated or removed as any
other lines.

This differs from packing products as you don't follow *product set*
are not linked to sale order other project once they are added.
