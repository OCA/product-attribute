This module provides easier products configuration (in one click).
It allows to configure a product template with only one field.

   :alt: profile field on product

**Main use case**: a lot of modules are installed (mrp, purchase, sale, pos)
and products configuration becomes harder for end users: too many fields to take care of.

You are concerned that at any time a product might be not configured correctly: this module is your friend.

Thanks to this module, a lot of complexity becomes hidden (default behavior) to the end user and usability is optimal.

It eases as well the data migration by only specifying the profile field instead of all fields which depend on it.

Note: This module is meant to be used by skilled people in database fields creation within the ERP framework.

Additional feature: a default value can be attached to a profile (see ยง Configuration, part 3)
