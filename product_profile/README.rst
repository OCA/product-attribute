This module provides easier products configuration (in one click).
It allows to configure a product template with only one field.

 .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/product-attribute/16.0/product_profile/static/img/field.png
   :alt: profile field on product
   :width: 600 px

**Main use case**: a lot of modules are installed (mrp, purchase, sale, pos)
and products configuration becomes harder for end users: too many fields to take care of.

You are concerned that at any time a product might be not configured correctly: this module is your friend.

Thanks to this module, a lot of complexity becomes hidden (default behavior) to the end user and usability is optimal.

It eases as well the data migration by only specifying the profile field instead of all fields which depend on it.

Note: This module is meant to be used by skilled people in database fields creation within the ERP framework.

Additional feature: a default value can be attached to a profile (see § Configuration, part 3)

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

1. Create your own profile here:
   Sales > Configuration > Product > Product Profiles

   .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/product-attribute/16.0/product_profile/static/img/list.png
     :alt: profile list
     :width: 600 px

   .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/product-attribute/16.0/product_profile/static/img/create.png
     :alt: profile create
     :width: 600 px

2. Extend "product.profile" model to add fields from product.template, either in normal mode or default mode (see note section below). These fields should be identical to their original fields **(especially "required" field attribute)**.

   .. code-block:: python

    class ProductProfile(models.Model):
      """ Require dependency on sale, purchase and point_of_sale modules
      """

      _inherit = "product.profile"

      def _get_types(self):
          return [("product", "Stockable Product"),
                  ("consu", 'Consumable'),
                  ("service", "Service")]

      sale_ok = fields.Boolean(
          string="Can be Sold",
          help="Specify if the product can be selected in a sales order line.")
      purchase_ok = fields.Boolean(
          string="Can be Purchased")
      available_in_pos = fields.Boolean()

3. Insert data (xml or csv) and define values for each field defined above
   for each configuration scenario

Note :
You might want to declare profile fields as defaults. To do this, just prefix the field with "profile_default".

   .. code-block:: python

    class ProductProfile(models.Model):
      profile_default_categ_id = fields.Many2one(
          "product.category",
          string="Default category",
        )
      profile_default_tag_ids = fields.Many2many(
          comodel_name="product.template.tag",
          string="Tags",
        )

Default fields only influence the records the first time they are set.
- if the profile is modified, changes are not propagated to all the records that have this profile
- if the record previously had another profile, changing profile will not influence default values

Usage
=====

Assign a value to the profile field in the product template form.
Then, all fields which depend on this profile will be set to the right value at once.

If you deselect the profile value, all these fields keep the same value and you can change them manually
(back to standard behavior).

Profiles are also defined as search filter and group.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Streamlined behaviour of default/nondefault fields in every situation
- More robust/less error-prone functionality for required fields or fields implicated in workflows
- More flexible/configurable behaviour for profile fields (instead of only default/nondefault fields)
