This module allows to generate internal references for Product templates and variants using sequences, setting codes as read-only.

In product template, it's possible to choose among different Internal Reference Templates related to a sequence, and then generate an internal reference with the following structure:

Internal Reference Prefix + progressive number for variant, eg: “Main0001001”, where:

"Main0001" is the prefix generated by sequence and assigned to product template, and

"001" the variant identifier.


Every time a new variant is created, a new internal reference is automatically assigned with progressive variant code.


A specific access rights allows specific users to change internal reference template for a product template once an internal reference has been generated, as well as editing existing ones.
