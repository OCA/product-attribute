This module allows to generate internal references for Product templates and variants using sequences, setting codes as read-only.

In product template, it's possible to choose among different Internal Reference Templates related to a sequence, and then generate an internal reference with the following structure:

Internal Reference Prefix + progressive number for variant, eg: “Main0001001”, where:

"Main0001" is the prefix generated by sequence and assigned to product template, and

"001" the variant identifier.


Every time a new variant is created, a new internal reference is automatically assigned with progressive variant code.


A specific access rights allows specific users to change internal reference template for a product template once an internal reference has been generated, as well as editing existing ones.

Usage
=====

Go to inventory > Configuration > Internal Reference Templates and set:

the sequence to be used for Internal Reference Prefix generation

the number of digits to be used for variants code (standard is 3)

Now go to product template, select an Internal Reference Template and generate an Internal Reference Prefix. Internal reference field is now read-only.

Each time a new variant is created for this product template, an internal reference is automatically assigned.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Due to odoo's behavior in handling internal reference for variants (see for example https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/140356 ), removing all attributes from a product template with variants will generate a new internal reference for product template.
